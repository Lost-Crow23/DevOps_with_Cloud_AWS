<h1>What is DevOps ? </h1>

It is essentially a methodology in the software development industry.
It integrates the use of development and the operations for the improvement 
of faster deployment within the life cycle. The combination is used to deliver
the products and thus improving and bridging the gap between the both sectors.

<h3>Why DevOps and benefits of DevOps ? </h3>

DevOps is a implemented process that has a range of benefits. The main benefits include,
faster and better deployment delivery, resolution and rectifying issues of complexity, 
the scalability of large projects are available, provides far better automation with the innovation
rate far exceeding within the business and development bridge.


<h3>4 Key pillars of the benefits of DevOps ?</h3>

The 4 key pillars are crucial within DevOps as they supports the DevOps journey of the company.
They are as follows:

 - DevOps Culture and Mindset (Communication)

For the better creation of software and faster deployment rate, communication is vital to plan, release, solve 
and improve the quality. With the continuous learning and the use of tools such as Jira, Trello, it makes it far easier
for the team to organise and help each other.

 - Automation and Tools

To have a stable environment with the consistent building and testing, it helps bridge the gap between the development and 
production thus improving the overall process. 

 - Quality-Driven and Monitoring

This requires providing crucial information that ensures the services are performing optimally.
Measuring the progress within the team benefits for making improvement and moving forward. Especially, 
as the ideas and processes rise, it's simple for the team, with the support of relevant data, to improve
the DevOps mindset.

 - Collaboration

Collaborating is key for the team and processing team so they can help, learn and have a agile method to deliver a complex task.
Streamlined process is achieved through collaboration, as it helps the understanding and preparing with 
the changes in the infrastructure, which avoids delay. 

<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>

Cloud computing is a virtual cloud that uses remote servers on the internet to store, process and manage data instead of relying on local computers or hosts. The delivery of services such as storage, databases and softwares are stored upon the internet. On demand access enables users to pay for their sole use, allowing them to be as cost efficient as possible so they don't need to be maintaining their own infrastructure. It is scalable, flexible and cost effective.

<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>

- Cost effective - upon subscription bases which can eliminate the need to buy and maintain such expensive software and hardware.
- Secruity - users' data is significantly protected with the use of robust protocols, like encryption, firewalls and access controls.
- Scalability - Users can scale their resources high and low depending on their need. So, adding more resources due to peak demands, or scaling back due to slow periods can be faster implemented.
- Accessibility - Can be essentially accessed from anywhere from the world with an web connection, making it easier for collaboration remotely.
- Recovery - If locally the data is destroyed or effected in any way, the cloud keeps the data saved and with enabled security, it keeps the data safe and accessible so that the data is never lost.
 
<h3>How does it fit into DevOps?</h3>

- Enabling collaboration without the downtime of back and forth files between the team.
- With version control, allows for simultaneous development to avoid complex dillemas between the software development.
- Global collaboration for remote projects built and tested on various environments.
 
<h3>How does It benefit the business?</h3>

In terms of business, automation of tasks such as advertising, marketing, procurement and payrol rely on the cloud. The main drive for business growth are, productiveness (accurate and up-to-date business information), secure the documentation and the business data (encryption with your private files), cost-effectiveness and the automation of more tasks (reducing workloads and increasing productivity).
